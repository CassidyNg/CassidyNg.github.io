                <p>
                    Hello! My name is Cassidy Ng and I am a junior at Tappan Zee High School. 
                    <br>
                    <br>My interest in Computer Science started mainly because of my older sister, who is currently
                    a CS major at Cornell University. She inspired me to give Computer Science a try during my
                    freshmen year of high school, and from there, my passion grew. Throughout my high school career,
                    I have taken several Computer Science classes and learned several languages such as Python, Java, Html, 
                    and CSS. I became a member of our 
                    Computer Science Club, Honor Society, and Robotics club. Through the projects and activities
                    offered from both my CS classes and extracuricculars, I've been able to allow my childish creativity
                    flow. I always enjoy seeing a program or idea run successfully. There is such satifaction
                    and relief when I see my code do what I intended it to, without errors. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Outside of school, I am a big baker. You can find me baking for my family and friends on several occasions 
                    such as for birthdays, Christmas, Mid-Autumn Festival, and more. I love being able to treat those who are close
                    to me. I am also a lover of fantasy and dystopian books. I can spend whole days reading a good book and
                    searching for new ones to add to my reading list. Additionally, I always enjoy playing instruments
                    and learning new pieces. I am a classically trained pianist of 9+ years, a cellist of 8+ years, and am 
                    currently trying to teach myself the guzheng.
