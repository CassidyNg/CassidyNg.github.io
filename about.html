                <p>
                    Hello! My name is Cassidy Ng and I am a junior at Tappan Zee High School. 
                    <br>
                    <br>My interest in Computer Science started mainly because of my older sister, who is currently
                    a CS major at Cornell University. She inspired me to give Computer Science a try during my
                    freshmen year of high school, and from there, my passion grew. Throughout my high school career,
                    I have taken several Computer Science classes and learned several languages such as Python, Java, Html, 
                    and CSS. I became a member of our 
                    Computer Science Club, Honor Society, and Robotics club. Through the projects and activities
                    offered from both my CS classes and extracuricculars, I've been able to allow my childish creativity
                    flow. I always enjoy seeing a program or idea run successfully. There is such satifaction
                    and relief when I see my code do what I intended it to, without errors. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Outside of school, I am a big baker. You can find me baking for my family and friends on several occasions 
                    such as for birthdays, Christmas, Mid-Autumn Festival, and more. I love being able to treat those who are close
                    to me. I am also a lover of fantasy and dystopian books. I can spend whole days reading a good book and
                    searching for new ones to add to my reading list. Additionally, I always enjoy playing instruments
                    and learning new pieces. I am a classically trained pianist of 9+ years, a cellist of 8+ years, and am 
                    currently trying to teach myself the guzheng.

                    Hello! My name is Cassidy Ng and I am a junior at Tappan Zee High School. 
                    <br>

                    I'm going to admit it. I wasn't always a huge STEM girl; in fact, I was solely an art and music lover who 
                    had no interest in anything else. From a young age, I already had a whole bunch of sketchbooks lined up on my shelves
                    and started my music journey by taking on piano and cello. I always thought I'd end up drawing and playing music. 
                    Who knew that I would eventually become so passionate about Computer Science and being a part of this STEM community. 
                    However, just because I changed interests it does not mean that I ran away from my childhood dreams. Through the projects
                    and activities offered through my CS classes and extracurriculars, I've allowed by childish creativity to flow, 
                    making little fantasies of mine become a reality with code.   
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Academically, I am an all Honors and AP student who took 2 APs my Sophomore year, 3 APs my Junior year, and hopefully 5 Aps 
                    my Senior year. I participate in twelve extracurriculars that include tutoring, volunteering community service, performing music, 
                    participating is Computer Science related activities, programming parts of a robot, and managing a team of 51+ students. I've
                    hosted outreach events for our school's robotics team, helped organize activities for Computer Science Club and Honor Society, 
                    and performed at our school's Multicultural Festival. As a Junior, I am also taking an online Chinese class through Virtual High School,
                    where I do weekly vocabulary lessons, discussions, videos, and quizzes.
