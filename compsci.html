                    <h1>Freshman</h1>
                    <p>This is the year my Computer Science journey started when I took my very first Computer Science class. I took Computer Science
                         I and II, where I learned the basics of Python and Java. I developed my programming skills by coding daily prompts in class, 
                         creating several projects, and interacting with different platforms such as Pygame and Greenfoot.

                <div class="grade-overview">
                    <h1>Sophomore</h1>
                    <p>As my interest in Computer Science grew, I decided that I would like to continue on this path, taking AP Computer Science A,
                        where I further advanced my knowledge of Java. I constantly worked on building different classes and focused on building a 
                        variety of skills in Java, scoring a 5 on the AP.

                    <h1>Junior</h1>
                    <p>After learning about two basic programming languages, I went on to take Computer Science Capstone Honors, a project based 
                        class where students choose one of their own interest. I started out by learning HTML and CSS to build my own website from
                        scratch, learning about Cyber Security to enhance my knowledge of specific fields of Computer Science...(more to come).
